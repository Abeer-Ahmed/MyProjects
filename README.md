My Projects
===========

This repository includes some simple projects I developed. The Electronic Hospital project is the most recent one. It's basically an application that helps the user to identify his/her disease based on the symptoms he/she is experiencing. It also lists some recommended drugs and suggests visiting some professional doctor in the field. The application relies on a simple .txt file to get the data from.

Some colleauge and I developed the snake game last summer. It's a modest consol-based game, devoid of any advanced graphical features.

The scientific calculator was the first project I ever worked on. I developed it on my own during the second semester of my first year at college.
